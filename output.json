  "plaintext": "Another challenge involved in the Agni payload design was related to the tremendous speed with which it would re-enter the atmosphere. In fact, Agni would re-enter the atmosphere at twelve times the speed of sound (Twelve Mach, as we call it in science). At this tremendous speed, we had no experience of how to keep the vehicle under control. To carry out a test, we had no wind tunnel to generate that kind of speed. If we sought American help, we would have been seen as aspiring to something they considered their exclusive privilege. Even if they consented to co-operate, they would be certain to quote a price for their wind tunnel greater than our entire project budget. Now, the question was how to beat the system. Prof. SM Deshpande of the IISc found four young, bright scientists working in the field of fluid dynamics and, within six months, developed the software for Computational Fluid Dynamics for Hypersonic Regimes, which is one of its kind in the world. Another achievement was the development of a missile trajectory simulation software, ANUKALPANA by Prof. IG Sharma of IISc to evaluate multi-target acquisition capabilities of an Akash-type weapon system. No country would have given us this kind of software, but we developed it indigenously. In yet another example of creating a synergy of scientific talent, Prof. Bharati Bhatt of IIT Delhi, working with the Solid Physics Laboratory (SPL) and Central Electronics Limited (CEL), broke the monopoly of the western countries by developing ferrite phase shifters for use in the multi-function, multi-tasking three-dimension Phased Army Radar for surveillence, tracking and guidance of Akash. Prof. Saraf of IIT, Kharagpur, working with BK Mukho-padhyay, my colleague at RCI, madeamillimetric wave (MMW)antenna for the Nag Seeker Head in two years, a record even by international standards. The Central Electrical and Electronics Research Institute (CEERI), Pilani developed an Impatt Diode in consortium with the SPL and RCI to overcome technological foreign dependence in creating these components, which are the heart of any MMW device."
